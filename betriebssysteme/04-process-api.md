## Execution Model

### Assembler (x86 Intel style)

The OS interacts directly with compiled programs. The following list is a set of (simplified) assembler instructions you should know.

- **mov**: Copy data from second operand to first operand

#### Arithmetic instructions

- **add, sub, mul, div**: add, subtract, multiply or divide two integer operands storing the result in the first operand  
- **inc, dec**: increment or decrement from register or memory location  
- **shl, shr**: bitshift left/right  
- **and, or, xor**: bitwise and/or/xor of two operands storing the result in the first operand  
- **not**: logical negation  

#### Control flow

- **jmp**: continue execution at given address  
- **je**: &ldquo;jump equal&rdquo; (jump if condition is true)  
- **jz**: &ldquo;jump zero&rdquo; (jump if operand is zero)  
- **call**: jump to a function (subroutine) by pushing current code location to stack  
- **return**:  return from subroutine (to return address on the stack)

#### Stack

The **stack pointer** (SP) holds the address of the top of the stack while the stack grows _downwards_. The SP points to the last allocated word (&ldquo;pre-decremented stack pointer&rdquo;).

- **push**: makes room for values on the stack by decrementing the SP and the inserting new element
- **pop**: cleans up values from the stack by incrementing the SP (removed data is not overwritten)

![Stack layout](img/04-stack.png)

A **base pointer** (BP), also known as **frame pointer** (FP), can be used to organize larger chunks of the stack called **stack frames**.

## Application Binary Interface

The **Application Binary Interface** (ABI) standardizes communication between applications and the OS.
It may specify executable/object file layout, calling conventions, stack alignment rules etc. The **calling conventions** define the way function calls are implemented in order to achieve interoperatibility across compilers. In C, these conventions are (historically) called **cdecl**.

**Example**: SystemV AMD64 ABI (used in Linux, BSD and OS X)

### x86 calling conventions

When a function is called, the calling function

- saves the state of the local scope
- sets up parameters where the called function can find them
- jumps to (*calls*) the called function

The called function

- sets up a new local scope
- runs its body (which may include calling other functions)
- puts the return value where the calling function can find them
- jumps back (*returns*) to the calling function
